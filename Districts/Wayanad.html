        Wayanad adorns the northern tip of Kerala and is among the few areas in the world that have managed to conserve their natural charm and beauty. Teeming with rare flora and fauna, it is considered among the most picturesque locations in Kerala. It is host to a large variety of endemic species. One is surrounded by mist-covered peaks and lush greenery on all sides. The tribals of the area are renowned for their unique customs and the festivals here are true celebrations of the harmony between man and nature. Many prominent resorts have come up in this area as well and provide our visitors with many adventure sports and trekking options in the very palms of nature.
