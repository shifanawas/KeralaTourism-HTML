    <p>Kerala is situated at the southwestern end of the Indian subcontinent. Kerala has a long history of art 
        and cultural heritage and foreign trade with other countries. The state with the highest literacy rate 
        in India is noted for its achievements in education, health, gender equality, social justice, law and 
        order. In addition to these, the state has the lowest infant mortality rate in the country.
        Kerala lies between the Arabian Sea in the West and the Western Ghats (Sahyadris) in the East with an 
        area of 38863 sq km. It is one of the five states in the linguistic-cultural area known as South 
        India. The neighbouring states of Kerala are Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Mayyazhi (Mahe / Mahe) is a 
        part of Pondicherry (Puducherry) and lies within Kerala. Though the Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea
        is part of the Union Territories,
        it has a close alliance with the linguistic and cultural heritage of Kerala.</p>
