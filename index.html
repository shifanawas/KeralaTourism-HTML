                <p>Kerala is situated at the southwestern end of the Indian subcontinent. Kerala has a long history of art 
                    and cultural heritage and foreign trade with other countries. The state with the highest literacy rate 
                    in India is noted for its achievements in education, health, gender equality, social justice, law and 
                    order. In addition to these, the state has the lowest infant mortality rate in the country.
                    Kerala lies between the Arabian Sea in the West and the Western Ghats (Sahyadris) in the East with an 
                    area of 38863 sq km. It is one of the five states in the linguistic-cultural area known as South 
                    India. The neighbouring states of Kerala are Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Mayyazhi (Mahe / Mahe) is a 
                    part of Pondicherry (Puducherry) and lies within Kerala. Though the Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea
                    is part of the Union Territories,
                    it has a close alliance with the linguistic and cultural heritage of Kerala.</p>
                    <p>
                        A substantial portion of Kerala including the western coastal lowlands and the plains 
                        of the midland may have been under the sea in ancient times. Marine fossils have been 
                        found in an area near Changanassery, thus supporting the hypothesis.Pre-historical 
                        archaeological findings include dolmens of the Neolithic era in the Marayur area of 
                        the Idukki district, which lie on the eastern highland made by Western Ghats. They are
                        locally known as "muniyara", derived from muni (hermit or sage) and ara (dolmen).
                        Rock engravings in the Edakkal Caves, in Wayanad date back to the Neolithic era around
                        6000 BCE. Archaeological studies have identified Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic 
                        sites in Kerala. The studies point to the development of ancient Kerala society and 
                        its culture beginning from the Paleolithic Age, through the Mesolithic, Neolithic and 
                        Megalithic Ages.[66] Foreign cultural contacts have assisted this cultural formation;
                        historians suggest a possible relationship with Indus Valley civilisation during the 
                        late Bronze Age and early Iron Age.
